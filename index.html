                <h3>Purposeful Life</h3>
                <p><em>高銘憲醫師, Ming-Shian Kao, M.D.</em></p>
                <p>TSA-STL is an elite group of highly motivated young scholars.  Many member of this organization are engaging in advanced studies of cutting-edge biomedical research. Your endeavors take tremendous amount of commitment in time, physical efforts, and intellectual drive.  Many of you have numerous accomplishments, but for a moment, I would like you to reflect on your ultimate goals and priorities in life.  Some of them are in your professional lives, some in your personal lives, and perhaps there might be one that combines both professional and personal goals.</p>
                <p>In this fast moving, highly competitive world of scientific research and academia, it is easy to believe that professional “success” equates with “happiness”.  Often, we focus on our research achievement and advancement to the next professional level.  However, this frequently comes at the expense of our emotional health and balance in life.</p>
		<p>The well-known Greek philosopher, Aristotle, use word eudaimonia to label happiness.  Among philosophers, it is common to stress that the word means “flourishing” rather than a subjective emotional state or kind of positive mood.  It is the concept of living as a human ought to live. It is finding a purpose in order to realize potential of our gifts, and working on our behavior to become the best version of ourselves.
My presentation today will tell a story. I will share a small part of my own career, which has spanned more than half a century. Rather than framing my story in terms of “Innovate New Technology”, this part of my career reflects another theme of this year’s symposium, “Broaden Vision”.  I hope my story will inspire you to consider how your own work can lead to the way of happier personal life and make contributions to generations to come.</p>

                <h3>Exploring the “red signal lights” in the brain—GABAA receptors, their function in brain health and diseases</h3>
                <p>
		<em>孫敏瑜博士, Min-Yu Sun PhD</em><br>
		Postdoctoral Research Associate, Dept. of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine
                </p>
                <p>Our brain is composed of around twenty billion neurons, which are actively processing information received from the external world and making proper responses afterward. These processes are “sensation” and “cognition”, involving production of electrical signals by active neurons, which behave like car drivers who need to obey traffic lights. In order for our brain to function properly, some neurons need to “stop driving” under certain circumstances while others “keep driving” actively to produce electrical signals. To determine whose turn to “drive”, a neurotransmitter receptor called “GABAAR” (γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor) plays a role like red signal lights in notifying neurons when to “stop driving”. If GABAARs are not working properly, all neurons will start “driving” to produce electrical signals, causing severe brain damages (the “car accidents” in the brain). In pathological conditions such as epilepsy, GABAARs lose normal function, resulting in abnormal neuronal “driving activity”— reflected as epileptic seizures. Therefore, understanding how to fix the “red signal lights in the brain” becomes a main focus for developing treatment strategy for epilepsy.
GABAARs can be divided into two populations—δ and γ-containing GABAARs, based on their subunit composition. The prevailing view suggests that δ works like regular red signal light, which stops neuronal activity for a good while. On the other hand, γ behaves more like flashing red signal light, which stops neuronal activity for only a limited amount of time. This view, however, still remains questionable because no method was available to separate these two receptor populations, and look into their behaviors individually. 
Our lab has recently created a way to separate δ and γ’s behaviors. By using a genetic tool called “CRISPR-Cas9”, we made a specialized mouse model that allows us to shut down γ’s function yet leave δ’s function unaffected. We found that δ also works like flashing red signal light in the brain, suggesting these two receptor populations are functionally overlapped rather than completely separated as previously thought. Identifying their function between “regular red signal light” and “flashing red signal light” allows us to restore their function accordingly, stopping the traffic chaos in the brain as well as in the real life. We believe that our findings not only change the prevailing view in this field, but also provide novel thoughts for fixing δ and γ’s function, respectively, for treating epilepsy.</p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>We tend to be sympathetic to the people and ideas that share the same or similar viewpoints with us. When this tendency is applied to the way we look at history, or, more specifically, the history of the American Revolution, it means that it is easy for us to be sympathetic to the revolutionaries since we believe that our society and democracy is, to certain extent, the product of their efforts. However, such sympathy does not help us truly understand the history of the American Revolution. During the American Revolution, no more than 33% of the population were true supporters of the Revolution, and about 25-33% of the population were Loyalists who supported Great Britain in this war. If we only study the Patriots, we miss half of the story of the American Revolution. Through studying the people who were very different than us, we open up further possibility to understand the real past of our world, and such possibility could help us better understand our own world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Though the original justification for patent laws is to promote innovations, empirical findings were ambiguous on the actual effect. Patent laws were setup to both provide legal monopoly protection to incentivize innovation and encourage innovators to disclose their findings to the public. However, researchers cannot agree on the effect of the strengthening of patent laws, with some showing an adverse effect on innovation activities. This talk will introduce important empirical results that shape the field and discuss the theories behind why patent laws may or may not work as intended.</p>

		<p>The translation of the evidence-base programs for preventing falls among medically underserved older adults has been limited. Exercise interventions can significantly reduce falls by improving balance, muscle strength, and functional mobility. However, low adherence continue to jargonize the effectiveness of the interventions. The Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) program could significantly reduce falls by teaching older adults to embed balance and muscle strength training in habitual daily routines. Thus, to accelerate the translation of LiFE among medically underserved older adults, a randomized feasibility study was conducted to establish the feasibility of the adapted LiFE program. We found the adapted LiFE program had good feasibility with high recruitment, retention, and adherence rate. This result indicate researchers could proceed to larger efficacy studies for medically underserved older adults.</p>

		<p>Congenital Heart Disease: Lead computational biologist for the whole exome sequencing (WES) and array genotyping analysis working groups in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium. I developed a novel statistical framework using the expected frequency of de novo mutation, controlling for local sequence context, to estimate the expected frequency of extremely rare transmitted variants. This enables comparison of the observed frequency of damaging variants in each gene to the expected value, completely independent of control subjects. I applied this methodology to a WES dataset of 2,871 congenital heart disease (CHD) probands to demonstrate that ~1.8% of cases are attributed to rare transmitted mutations (Jin SC, et al., Nature Genetics 2017). Novel genes were implicated, including dominant loss of function mutations in the VEGF receptor FLT4 in tetralogy of Fallot, recessive mutations in MYH6 in Shone syndrome, and discovery of a recessive founder mutation in GDF1 Ashkenazim that accounts for ~5% of CHD in this population. In addition, heterozygous de novo mutations in 46 different genes encoding chromatin modifiers account for 3% of probands. Sixty-six different genes had two or more de novo damaging mutations, with more than 70% of these being disease-causing. There is very high locus heterogeneity, with an estimated 400 different genes causing CHD by de novo mutation.</p>
		<p>Cerebral Palsy: Co-lead the Bioinformatics group with Drs. Michael Kruer, Jozef Gecz, and Richard Wintle to perform large-scale whole exome/genome sequencing analyses for the International Cerebral Palsy Genomics Consortium. We identified significant enrichment of de novo mutations in 249 cerebral palsy cases, which could account for ~12% of patients and revealed significant enrichment of a novel pathway, GTPase signal transduction, in the cerebral palsy pathogenesis via pathway and network analyses (Jin SC, et al., under review Nature Genetics).</p>
		<p>Rare Mendelian Diseases: Lead genomic analysis and methodology development in several genetic studies of complex disease, including congenital hydrocephalus, Vein of Galen malformation, Chiari malformation, trigeminal neuralgia, Dent disease, arachnoid cyst, nephrotic syndrome, and congenital hemangioma, for the Yale Center for Mendelian Genomics. </p>
		<p>Mar. 2011-Sept. 2014 Graduate Research Assistant, Washington University School of Medicine<br>
		Prof. Alison M. Goate (advisor), Department of Genetics<br>
		Prof. Carlos Cruchaga (co-advisor), Department of Psychiatry</p>
		<p>Conducted pooled deep-resequencing experiments, and performed genomic/statistical analyses for known Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s associated genes to demonstrate that: (1) rare variants in a novel gene PLD3 significantly confer risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD); (2) rare variants in TREM2 increase risk for late-onset AD; (3) variants in TREML2, a gene adjacent to TREM2, protect against late-onset AD; (4) novel causal mutations in PSEN1, GRN, and MAPT are found in familial AD cases; (5) the effect of PSEN1-p.E318G on AD susceptibility is dependent on an interaction with APOE-ε4 alleles and mediated by Aβ deposition and: (6) novel variants in the primary Parkinson’s Mendelian and genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified genes that contribute to the Parkinson’s disease.</p>
		<p>Performed GWAS using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, disease age at onset, brain gene expression, and myeloid cell expression as disease endophenotypes to identify common risk variants in SPI1 associated with AD.</p>
		<p>Performed in-vitro cell-based functional experiments to show that risk variants in TREM2 may impart effects by modulating ligand-binding efficiency.</p>

                <p>Christine obtained her PhD in Plant Biology at Michigan State University Plant Research Labs (PRL) working on hormone signaling and how plants respond to herbivore stress using the plant model system Arabidopsis. With an interest to translate her findings in Arabidopsis to economically important crop species, she obtained a USDA postdoctoral fellowship to characterize hormone responses in millet (Setaria viridis) and corn. Through her postdoctoral experience, she participated in developing genome editing, RNA-seq and high throughput phenotyping pipelines in grass systems. She joined Monsanto (now Bayer Crop Science) as a genome editing scientist in 2017. 
Christine is passionate about improving modern agriculture through innovative science and dynamic collaborations. She welcomes conversations on GMO, gene editing and plant biotechnology.
